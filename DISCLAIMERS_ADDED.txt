DISCLAIMERS AND NOTICES ADDED TO REPOSITORY
================================================================================

The following prominent disclaimers have been added to all documentation files
to make it crystal clear that these are EXAMPLE TEMPLATES for demonstration
and learning purposes.

================================================================================
1. README.md
================================================================================

LOCATION: Right after title, before "Available MCP Servers" table

DISCLAIMER ADDED:
- Section: "⚠️ IMPORTANT: Example Templates"
- Emphasizes these are demonstration examples and starting templates
- Lists extensive customization possibilities:
  * Security enhancements (auth, API keys, rate limiting, VPC, WAF)
  * User-specific storage (per-user S3, session mgmt, workspace isolation)
  * Custom features (domain-specific tools, API integration, databases)
  * Advanced capabilities (SQS, Step Functions, streaming, WebSocket)
- Encourages users to "Go crazy!" with customizations
- Makes it clear the architecture supports any enhancement

LOCATION: End of document, after Summary section

SECTION ADDED:
- "📄 License & Disclaimer"
- MIT License notice
- Clear disclaimer about educational purposes
- States not hardened for production without customization
- Users responsible for security, compliance, best practices
- "Use at your own risk" warning
- Reminds users to review, test, and secure before production

SUMMARY SECTION UPDATED:
- Changed "production-ready" to "example MCP server templates"
- Emphasized "Extensible Foundation"
- Added reminder: "These are starting templates!"
- Updated Quick Start to include "customize as needed"

================================================================================
2. QUICKSTART.md
================================================================================

LOCATION: Right after title, before Prerequisites

DISCLAIMER ADDED:
- Section: "⚠️ IMPORTANT: These are Example Templates"
- States servers are demonstration examples
- Lists key areas to extend:
  * User authentication and authorization
  * Per-user storage isolation
  * Custom security layers
  * Domain-specific features
  * Rate limiting and usage tracking
  * Production requirements
- Encourages: "Feel free to customize extensively!"
- Positions as starting points for production servers

================================================================================
3. DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md
================================================================================

LOCATION: After title, before Table of Contents

DISCLAIMER ADDED:
- Section: "⚠️ IMPORTANT: Example Templates for Demonstration"
- States these are example implementations
- Clarifies they're fully functional but intentionally simplified
- "Production Considerations" subsection lists enhancements:
  * Security (auth, API keys, rate limiting)
  * User Isolation (per-user storage, workspace separation, encryption)
  * Custom Features (domain logic, system integration)
  * Monitoring (metrics, alerting, tracing)
  * Compliance (audit logs, data retention, regulatory features)
- Emphasizes: "These examples are your starting point"
- Notes architecture is flexible and scalable

================================================================================
4. REPOSITORY_SUMMARY.txt
================================================================================

UPDATED: Added prominent notice at top

NOTICE ADDED:
- "⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTICE ADDED:" section
- States all documentation files now include disclaimer
- Notes examples are intentionally simple starting points
- Mentions users encouraged to extend with custom features

================================================================================
KEY MESSAGES ACROSS ALL FILES
================================================================================

✅ These are EXAMPLE TEMPLATES and DEMONSTRATIONS
✅ Intentionally simplified for LEARNING and EDUCATION
✅ Work out-of-the-box for DEMOS
✅ Should be EXTENDED and CUSTOMIZED for production
✅ Not hardened without additional security/features
✅ Users responsible for implementing production requirements
✅ Architecture supports ANY enhancement you can imagine
✅ "Go crazy!" with customizations

================================================================================
CUSTOMIZATION IDEAS PROVIDED
================================================================================

The disclaimers specifically mention these extension possibilities:

🔐 SECURITY:
   - User authentication and authorization
   - API key validation
   - Rate limiting and throttling
   - VPC isolation
   - Request signing and verification
   - WAF rules

💾 USER STORAGE:
   - Per-user S3 prefixes/buckets
   - User session management
   - User preferences storage
   - Workspace isolation
   - Multi-tenancy support
   - Data encryption at rest

🎨 CUSTOM FEATURES:
   - Domain-specific tools
   - API integrations
   - Database connections (RDS, DynamoDB)
   - Caching layers (ElastiCache, CloudFront)
   - Custom logging and metrics
   - Business logic
   - Third-party services (Stripe, Twilio, etc.)

📊 ADVANCED:
   - Queue-based processing (SQS)
   - Async workflows (Step Functions)
   - Streaming responses
   - WebSocket support
   - Batch processing
   - Data transformation pipelines

🔍 MONITORING:
   - Enhanced CloudWatch metrics
   - Alerting
   - Distributed tracing

📋 COMPLIANCE:
   - Audit logging
   - Data retention policies
   - Regulatory compliance features

================================================================================
TONE AND MESSAGING
================================================================================

The disclaimers are written to be:
✅ Clear and prominent (warning emoji, bold text)
✅ Encouraging rather than restrictive
✅ Educational and helpful
✅ Specific with actionable suggestions
✅ Enthusiastic about customization ("Go crazy!")
✅ Responsible (disclaimers about production use)

================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

ALL documentation now makes it abundantly clear that:

1. These are example/template implementations
2. They work for demos and learning
3. They should be extended for production
4. Extensive customization is expected and encouraged
5. Users are responsible for production hardening
6. The architecture supports unlimited enhancement

No one can mistake these for "production-ready-as-is" systems.
They are clearly positioned as educational starting points.
